            <p>During the design phase, I conducted usability testing several times. Testing with users enables me to identify spaces for improvement and refine my design for better usability and experience that caters to users’ needs. Below are some design improvements that I made during the testing phase;</p>

                </div>
                <p>I changed the way to rate experience with users. During the testing, some people mentioned that they would hesitate to rate users or they would only rate 1 or 5 because they can’t treat people like products on Amazon. I put five emojis that users can express their feeling and experience with other users.</p>

                </div>
                <p>I changed the way to join events. Initially, there was a “Request button” on the event page to send a request to the event host to join the event. But from the usability testing, I got some feedbacks such as “I want to chat with people to get to know each other first before meeting people.”, so I enabled event hosts to send the invitation to users who want to join when they feel meeting them.</p>

                <p>During this project, there were many iterations based on research, usability testing, and critiques from other designers and people around me. It was a long process, but I was excited as the designs become more optimized for the users. Being born in Japan and having lived most of my life in Japan, this app was something that I was really passionate about. There were so many things where I wanted to leverage my experience on this project, but I always kept this quote in my mind;</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>‍“As a designer, you need to remove your ego. You design things not for you, for others”.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>‍It was also challenging that I needed to consider and approach things from two sides: both Japanese and non-Japanese perspectives, but trying something I have never done before is always exciting for me. I will keep polishing my design for this app and making it better for users and for myself as one of the designers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I appreciate all my friends who have been supporting me and made me realize that learning different cultures is really fun.
